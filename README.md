This repository contains mini apps which is created for the purpose of mini project.

This mini project contains :

Music Player
Quiz app
Pdf reader
to-do List
analog clock

the best part about this project is this can be expanded as much as someone want and this can become ultimate help for a student, like in a lot of ways if he want
to read a book then he can read it, if he wants to listen songs then he can listen anytime and any song, if someone want to organize a quiz then they can organize a quiz(feature to
be added),checking time,if you keeps forgetting things then the best help you can give yourself is to maintain a schedule or a list that would help you in not missing your important
work.
Thats the goal pretty much..,,
